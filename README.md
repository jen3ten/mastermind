# Mastermind

This is a C# console application with xUnit tests that is a simple version of Mastermind.  

The game randomly generates an answer that is four (4) digits in length, with each digit between the numbers 1 and 6.  After the player enters a combination, a minus (-) sign will be printed for every digit that is correct but in the wrong position, and a plus (+) sign will be printed for every digit that is both correct and in the correct position.  Nothing will be printed for incorrect digits.  The player has ten (10) attempts to guess the number correctly before receiving a message that they have lost.

To play, clone this project to your computer.  Open the project in Visual Studio.  Run the application.  Have fun and good luck!
